I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) (UIUC), advised by [Prof. Sarita V. Adve](http://sadve.cs.illinois.edu/). Before joining UIUC, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu).

Research Interests
